Description ---
Uber, Lyft, Ola and many more online ride hailing services are trying hard to use their extensive data to create data products such as pricing engines, driver allotment etc. To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied or in other words the trip duration. This project will cover techniques to extract important features and accurately predict trip duration for taxi trips in New York using data from TLC commission New York.
